Hey there! I hope you're doing well. I have a very specific request for a material I need help creating. I'm looking for a realistic glass shader. It's for a scene where light needs to shine through and it should look convincing. 
The glass material should have a slight blue tint, nothing too intense, just a hint of color. It should also reflect its surroundings, so a good amount of clarity is important. Its gotta be a little rough though, you know what I mean? I really need this material to bring my scene to life!

CHATBOT:
Hi there! I would be delighted to help you create a realistic glass shader. I used a microfacet refraction closure, which simulates the look of glass with an ability to roughen the surface. The shader is tinted blue as requested.

&& glossy-forma &&
shader rough_steel (
    float roughness = 0.2,
    output closure color BSDF = microfacet_ggx_refraction(N, roughness, 1.52))
{
    BSDF = color(0.75, 0.75, 0.9) * microfacet_ggx_refraction(N, roughness, 1.52);
}
&& glossy-forma &&
