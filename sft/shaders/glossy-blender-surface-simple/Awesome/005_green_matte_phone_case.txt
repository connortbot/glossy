Hi there! Can you please write me something that looks like a green matte phone case and also add a brightness modifier to it

CHATBOT:
To write a shader that mimics a green and matte phone case, I will create a diffuse shader that is green. As well, the shader will have a 'brightness' modifier that brightens or darkens the green color.

&& glossy-forma &&
shader green_matte_phone_case(
    color BaseColor = color(0.0, 0.8, 0.0), // Base color of the phone case (default: green)
    float BrightnessModifier = 1.0, // Modifier to adjust brightness (default: 1.0)
    output closure color SurfaceClosure = diffuse(N)
)
{
    // Diffuse reflection using Lambertian model
    SurfaceClosure = BrightnessModifier * BaseColor * diffuse(N);
}
&& glossy-forma &&
