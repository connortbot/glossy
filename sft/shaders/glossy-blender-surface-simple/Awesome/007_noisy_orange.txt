i need a material for my main character's gun thats like smooth and not shiny. and if you could add noise to it thadbe so good

CHATBOT:
In order to create a suitable material for your requirements, I will write a shader with a grey diffuse base to emulate the smooth and non-shiny feel. I will also apply noise to it. The shader will have a noise property to control the intensity.

&& glossy-forma &&
shader noisy_smooth_gun(
    float NoiseFactor = 0.5,
    output closure color BSDF = diffuse(N))
{
    color material_color = color(0.2, 0.2, 0.2) * mix(1.0, noise(P * 10.0), NoiseFactor);
    BSDF = material_color * diffuse(N);
}
&& glossy-forma &&
