can you make me a diffuse shader? it shoudl start as red but let me change the colour

CHATBOT:
To create a red diffuse shader for Blender Cycles, I will write a shader with a 'colour' property that defaults to a red value.

&& glossy-forma &&
shader diffuseRed(
    color colour = color(1.0, 0.0, 0.0),
    output closure color DIFFUSE = diffuse(N))
{
    DIFFUSE = colour * diffuse(N);
}
&& glossy-forma &&
