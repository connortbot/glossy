make a red velvet material

CHATBOT:
In order to write a shader that creates a red velvet material for Blender's Cycles, I will create a red Ashikhmin velvet shader that takes in a roughness field.

&& glossy-forma &&
shader red_velvet(
    float roughness = 0,
    output closure color VelvetClosure = ashikhmin_velvet(N, roughness)
)
{
    VelvetClosure = color(0.8, 0.0, 0.0) * ashikhmin_velvet(N, roughness);
}
&& glossy-forma &&

ashikhmin_velvet comes out black in render? in Cycles...
