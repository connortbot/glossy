i wrote this shader for a green object

shader diffgren(output closure color shaderOut = diffuse(N))
{shaderOut = color(0.1, 0.99, 0.1) * diffuse(N);}
but i want it to look a little rough, help!

CHATBOT:
This shader is a good start! To modify the shader to make it a little rough, we can use the Oren Nayar closure which acts similarly to the diffuse closure that you used. However, it also can take in a roughness value.

&& glossy-forma &&
shader diffgren(
    output closure color shaderOut = oren_nayar(N, 0.2)
)
{
    shaderOut = color(0.1, 0.99, 0.1) * oren_nayar(N, 0.2);
}
&& glossy-forma &&

This shader applies a 0.2 roughness value to the green material.
