how do i make my material thats non glossy?

CHATBOT:
To achieve a non-glossy effect, you can use a diffuse shader. Here is how this is achieved in OSL:

&& glossy-forma &&
shader matte_shader(
    color baseColor = color(0.4, 0.4, 0.4),
    output closure color BSDF = diffuse(N))
{
    BSDF = baseColor * diffuse(N);
}
&& glossy-forma &&
