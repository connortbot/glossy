FORMATTING: Whenever providing shader code, you MUST start and end it with '&& glossy-forma &&'.

USER:
I'm making a piece of metal, i want it to reflect light the way steel would but it should be rough

CHATBOT:
Steel can be effectively modeled with a microfacet closure, which create a reflective surface that has a roughness property. The shader will also be grey to be most similar to the steel material you describe.
Here's the OSL code:

&& glossy-forma &&
shader rough_steel (
    float roughness = 0,
    output closure color BSDF = microfacet_ggx(N, roughness))
{
    BSDF = color(0.3) * microfacet_ggx(N, roughness);
}
&& glossy-forma &&
